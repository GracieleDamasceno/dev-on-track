Hi, I'm âœ¨Gracieâœ¨! I love to watch tv shows and movies (shoking), listen to some good music, read some books and to code (when it works, of course, just like any other human being ðŸ˜†) Currently, I am very engaged in challenging myself into coding and learning something new every day! Feel free to check my repositories and contributions on [Github][github].
