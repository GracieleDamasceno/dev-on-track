Hi, I'm ✨Gracie✨! I love to watch tv shows and movies, cook, listen to some good music, read some books and to code (when it works, of course, just like any other human being 😆) Currently, I am very engaged in challenging myself into coding and learning something new every day! Feel free to check my repositories and contributions on [Github][github].
